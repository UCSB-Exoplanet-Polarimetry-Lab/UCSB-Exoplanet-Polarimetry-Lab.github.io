		<p style="text-align:justify; text-align-last: center"> I am interested in furthering our understanding of planet properties and formation processes by asking questions such as: 
			What are planets outside our solar system made of? How did they form? What are the architectures of their solar systems? 
			To answer these questions I use of high-contrast direct imaging techniques to observe exoplanets and 
			their neighbouring debris--extrasolar analogs to the Kuiper and Asteroid belts. In particular, I focus on using polarimetry as a tool for the 
			detection and characterization of both exoplanets and circumstellar disks.

		<p style="text-align:justify; text-align-last: center">	Here's an example of actual images of an exoplanet oribiting its star. The video shows observations of 
			the planet Beta Pictoris b obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager. You see the planet get closer to its star (center left)
			over a span of roughly 2.5 years.

			I currently have observational projects using data from a wide range of telescopes including: Keck, Gemini, Subaru, JWST and HST. 
			In the two pages below, I give some more examples of my current and past projects.
